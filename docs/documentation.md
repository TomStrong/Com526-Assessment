# Design Documentation

## Requirements
For this project, we were required to develop a simple web-based Point of Sale application that allowed a user to enter their credit card details (name, card number, expiry date, cvv code) for either a payment or a refund. The application would then need to communicate with the mock banking service using the ReST service supplied to either confirm or deny the transaction.

In addition, the Point of Sale device needed to be configurable by an admin user as transactions would require the data associated with the PoS device to transfer funds to or from the correct user account.
